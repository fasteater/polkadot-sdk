The Polkadot SDK repository provides all the resources needed to start building on the [Polkadot](www.polkadot.network) network, 
a multi-chain blockchain platform that enables different blockchains to interoperate and share information in a secure and scalable
way.

* Rust Docs, SDK level Documentation
 * Getting Started
 * Introduction each component of the Polkadot SDK: Substrate, FRAME, Cumulus, and XCM

## üöÄ Releases

> [!NOTE]  
> Our release process is still Work-In-Progress and may not yet reflect the aspired outline here.

The Polkadot-SDK has two release channels: `stable` and `nightly`. Production software is advised to only use `stable`.
`nightly` is meant for tinkerers to try out the latest features. The detailed release process is described in
[RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md).

### üòå Stable

`stable` releases have a support duration of **three months**. In this period, the release will not have any breaking
changes. It will receive bug fixes, security fixes, performance fixes and new non-breaking features on a **two week**
cadence.

### ü§† Nightly

`nightly` releases are released every night from the `master` branch, potentially with breaking changes. They have
pre-release version numbers in the format `major.0.0-nightlyYYMMDD`.

## üîê Security

The security policy and procedures can be found in [docs/contributor/SECURITY.md](./docs/contributor/SECURITY.md).

## Polkadot Fellowship

Development in this repo usually goes hand in hand with the `fellowship` organization. In short, this repository provides all the SDK 
pieces needed to build both Polkadot and its parachains. But, the actual Polkadot runtime lives in the `fellowship/runtimes` repository. 
Read more about the fellowship, this separation, the RFC process [here](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/index.html). 

## History

This repository is the amalgamation of 3 separate repos that used to constitude Polkadot SDK, namely Substrate, Polkadot and Cumulus.
